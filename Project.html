                    being able to jump, attack enemies, and take damage. My role
                    in creating this was making the character mechanics, his 
                    sprites, attacks and helped create the enemies. We learned 
                    how to create working games using Scratch. Challenges that 
                    we had to overcome were the attacking and jumping mechanics,

                    to successfully build a working mobile game that had 
                    powerups, enemies, and a score. I learned how to create
                    games using App Inventor. Challenges that we had to overcome
                    was the spawn point, flying, and getting the enemies to
                    work. In this project, I was mainly the support role, 
                    helping Jared create this game while doing some coding
                    myself. </p>

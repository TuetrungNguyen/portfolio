            <p> <strong> In this world technology</strong> is continuously
            evolving, becoming more
            and more advance. I want to be one of those people who are holding 
            the reins, and help build the future. My goal is to graduate from UC
            Berkeley with a master's degree in software development' along with
            a bachelor's degree in math and science. The reason why I want to
            go down this path is because ever since I have tried out 
            programming, I was entranced by how it could be applied for, 
            and what it could create. Joining the programming world would 
            allow me to further dive into the concept and use my abilities to 
            create new things. In the programming world, many projects require git
            a lot of time to create, working with others, and being able to find
            bugs. One time when I was doing a website project, there were many 
            bugs in the code, and was taking more than a few weeks. 
            Nevertheless, not discouraged, after a long time of patiently
            looking for the needle in the haystack, I managed to find the 
            bugs and fixed them. The result was a fully functional website 
            that was managed to be showcased over thousands of others in my
            coding class. Another time, I was volunteering for 'Kids Against 
            Hunger' (KAH) and went to one of their volunteer places. There, 
            I saw many people of different ages that wanted to help. Together,
            we all managed to package food for thousands of kids in need. 
            I have also worked at my father's business, 4YourBusiness, over the 
            summer for many years. What I have experienced has allowed me to
            grow and learn many skills. From working and volunteering, I learned
            to have patience and how to work with others. From my coding class
            I took, I learned how to code and managed to get programming 
            experience. In the future, I hope to get into UC Berkeley and
            receive a Master's degree in software development. Along with 
            other subjects I believe can help me in the future. Thank you for
            your consideration and time.

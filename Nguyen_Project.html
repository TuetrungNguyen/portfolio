                            <p>In the project, the objective that my partner 
                            (Alex Schwarz) and I were trying to achieve was to 
                            successfully create a python (Programming language) 
                            program that would be able to edit an image. The 
                            project was about creating a photo editing program 
                            that was easily creative and easily accessible. 
                            To make it work, you would type in the name of the 
                            image and what you wanted to do with it. 
                            My partner and I shared the same role, coming up with the
                            ideas, coding, documenting, and creating the slides 
                            for the project. Through this project, I learned 
                            how to use Python better and how to organize my 
                            documentation better.</p>

                                <p>In this project, the objective that my partner 
                                (Jared Smith) and I were trying to achieve was to 
                                successfully build a working mobile game that had 
                                powerups, enemies, and a score. We chose a project 
                                to base our game out off, and worked from that. The 
                                basic version was a game where you tapped the screen
                                to make the character fly, and have the character 
                                avoid obstacles. We changed it so that the background
                                was different, added obstacles, enemies,
                                powerups, and changed how the character looked. 
                                Challenging aspects we had to overcome was getting 
                                our character to actually "fly" and creating powerups.
                                Through this project, I learned how to create games 
                                using sites/apps like App Inventor.</p>
